I am planning to stay for a couple of days, maybe a few so I can enjoy some time away with my family and have fun. Though I am always on the cheaper side of things, this time I am planning to spend a little more on accommodation, 100 dollars would not hurt my pocket that much for each night of our stay, I am determined to make it an unforgettable time.Return the answer in JSON format: {'airbnb':['my_airbnb']} ",
