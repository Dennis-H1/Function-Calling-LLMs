Some people who are environmentally conscious or ethically motivated may choose specific dietary patterns, such as vegetarianism or veganism, which could coincide with a particular cultural or social scene that may also have distinct musical preferences. While meat can be a valuable part of a balanced diet, it is essential to be aware of the potential health risks associated with certain practices in the meat industry. Making informed choices about the sources and types of meat consumed, as well as advocating for sustainable and humane farming practices, can contribute to a healthier and more responsible approach to meat consumption. Even though I try not to consume meat for health reasons, I feel bad when I consume it. Listening metal also makes me feel in low spirits. Can you return 5 least recent albums of Radiohead.
