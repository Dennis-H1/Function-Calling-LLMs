          "question": "People's preferences in music and food are complex and multifaceted, influenced by a wide range of individual and cultural factors. Some people who are environmentally conscious or ethically motivated may choose specific dietary patterns, such as vegetarianism or veganism, which could coincide with a particular cultural or social scene that may also have distinct musical preferences. While meat can be a valuable part of a balanced diet, it is essential to be aware of the potential health risks associated with certain practices in the meat industry. Making informed choices about the sources and types of meat consumed, as well as advocating for sustainable and humane farming practices, can contribute to a healthier and more responsible approach to meat consumption. Even though I try not to consume meat for health reasons, I feel bad when I consume it. Listening metal also makes me feel in low spirits. Can you return 5 least recent albums of Radiohead.

          "question": " I want to find five nice looking apartments at the heart of Manhattan where I would like to spend some joyful days for Christmas. I am planning to stay for a couple of days, maybe five so I can enjoy some time away with my family and have fun. Though I am always on the cheaper side of things, this time I am planning to spend a little more on accommodation, 100 dollars would not hurt my pocket that much for each night of our stay, I am determined to make it an unforgettable time.Return the answer in JSON format: {'airbnb':['my_airbnb']} ",
